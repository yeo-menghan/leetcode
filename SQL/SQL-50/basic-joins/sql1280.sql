/*
- CROSS JOIN produces the Cartesian product â€” every student combined with every subject.
    - count how many times each student attended each subject, including subjects where the student has zero attendance.
- The GROUP BY clause is necessary because you want to aggregate (count exams attended)
    -  count per unique combination of student and subject.
